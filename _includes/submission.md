Participants were asked to adapt and submit their symbolic regression algorithms to SciBench
These methods were automatically tested for the the competition.


## Submission Directories

For the convenience of evaluting each of the algorithms, we need to enforce the following requirements about the directory so that we can sucessfully run your algorthm. 

1. you need to compress your code impelemntion into a **zip** file.

2. Specify the extra packages and exact versions in **requirements.txt**, which are required to be installed before running your algorithms.

2. In side your zip folder, the directory should contains **main.py** function, which is the default file to call your proposed algorithm.

```bash
YOUR_ALGOITHM/
    main.py
    requirements.txt
    extra_files....
```






## Submission Site

To participate of the competition, each member of the team must submit their proposed algorithms with the link corresponding to the desired track. The first member to enroll will create a team name and the other members will choose their team from the list of choices. After enrolling, you are good to go!
