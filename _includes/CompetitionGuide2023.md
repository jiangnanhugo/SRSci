# Symbolic Regression Competition - 2023

tl;dr the first edition of the symbolic regression competition will allow the participants to experiment with their own pipeline to submit the best symbolic regression model. We will have two tracks: best accuracy-simplicity trade-off. Read below for more details and donâ€™t forget to join our Discord server at [https://discord.gg/MeGnkHr4](https://discord.gg/MeGnkHr4).



# Call for participation


The participants will have the freedom to apply their own pipeline with the objective of returning symbolic models that best describe the data. 
The models will be evaluated according to accuracy and simplicity.

The competition will start 01-May-2023 and last 3 months. The participants will gain access to 10 synthetic symbolic equations.
During the three months, the participants can apply an SR approach or pipeline of their choice, e.g., their own novel algorithm or an existing SR package, as well as pre- and post-processing methods (e.g., feature construction and model simplification, respectively) to find suitable symbolic models for the corresponding data sets. 

Enrollment will be done via Easychair.org, at a link to be announced soon. 
This will result in a private repository that can be accessed only by the participating team and the organizers.  
The repository contains detailed submission instructions, a default directory structure, and the data sets for the two tracks.

# Track - Performance

The participants will be free to experiment with these data sets until the deadline. 
Analysis on each dataset should include the production of a single best model for each dataset, and an extended abstract discussing the pipeline.

At the competition submission deadline the repository of a participating team should contain:

- [required] A file containing a single model as a **sympy-compatible expression**, selected as the best expression for that data set, named `dataset_X_best_model`.
- [required] A maximum 4 page extended abstract in PDF format describing the algorithm and pipeline. This PDF must contain the name and contact information of the participants.
- [to be eligible for prize] Reproducibility documentation in the `src` folder.
    - Installation and execution instructions 
    - Scripts (Jupyter Notebook is accepted) with detailed instructions of all steps used to produce models (including hyperparameters search, if any)
