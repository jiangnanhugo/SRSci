# Symbolic Regression Competition - 2023

tl;dr the first edition of the symbolic regression competition will allow the participants to experiment with their own pipelines to submit the best symbolic regression model.



# Call for participation


The participants will have the freedom to apply their own pipeline with the objective of returning symbolic models that best describe the data. 
The models will be evaluated according to accuracy and simplicity.


## TODO

The participants will be free to experiment with these data sets until the deadline. 
Analysis on each dataset should include the production of a single best model for each dataset, and an extended abstract discussing the pipeline.

At the competition submission deadline the repository of a participating team should contain:

- [required] A file containing a single model as a **sympy-compatible expression**, selected as the best expression for that data set, named `dataset_X_best_model`.
- [required] A maximum 4 page extended abstract in PDF format describing the algorithm and pipeline. This PDF must contain the name and contact information of the participants.
- [to be eligible for prize] Reproducibility documentation in the `src` folder.
    - Installation and execution instructions 
    - Scripts (Jupyter Notebook is accepted) with detailed instructions of all steps used to produce models (including hyperparameters search, if any)
