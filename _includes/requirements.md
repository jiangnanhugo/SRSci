Solver Requirements
=====================

### Computing Environment

The evaluations will be run on Linux machines with up to 8 CPU cores and 20 GB memory.



### Submission Directories

For the convenience of evaluting each of the algorithms, we need to enforce the following requirements about the directory so that we can sucessfully run your algorthm. 

1. you need to compress your code impelemntion into a **zip** file.

2. Specify the extra packages and exact versions in **requirements.txt**, which are required to be installed before running your algorithms.

2. In side your zip folder, the directory should contains **main.py** function, which is the default file to call your proposed algorithm.

```bash
YOUR_ALGOITHM/
    main.py
    requirements.txt
    extra_files....
```



This competition seeks to distill algorithmic design choices and improve the practice of symbolic regression. 
These datasets will be sourced mainly from the domains of physics.

Participants were asked to adapt and submit their symbolic regression algorithms to SciBench following the [Competition Guide](/srbench/competition-guide/).
These methods were automatically tested for the the competition.
Winners of the *public* and *private* track are each entitled to a $1 cash prize.  


## Leadboard

In the synthetic track, methods were compared according to five properties: 1) re-discovery of exact expressions; and 2) sensitivity to noise.
