## Environmental Requirements


### Hardware Budget

The evaluations will be run on Linux machines with up to 8 CPU cores and 20 GB memory.

### Time Budget

Methods must adhere to a fixed time budget for the competition. 
*These time budgets are designed to be **generous**, not **restrictive***. 
Our goal is to allow "slow" implementations enough time to learn. 


The time limits are as follows:

- For datasets up to 3 variables, 30 minutes (0.5 hour)
- For datasets up to 10 variables, 180 minutes (3 hours)
