# SRBench Competition 2023


This competition seeks to distill algorithmic design choices and improve the practice of symbolic regression. 
These datasets will be sourced mainly from the domains of physics.

Participants were asked to adapt and submit their symbolic regression algorithms to SciBench following the [Competition Guide](/srbench/competition-guide/).
These methods were automatically tested for the the competition.
Winners of the *public* and *private* track are each entitled to a $1 cash prize.  


## Leadboard

In the synthetic track, methods were compared according to five properties: 1) re-discovery of exact expressions; and 2) sensitivity to noise.
